# Website Structure & Design for Dual-Discipline Portfolio (Marketing + Coding)

## Global Theme & Structure

- **Main Concept**: Dual Expertise ‚Äì Marketing üß† + Coding üíª
- **Split Layout**:
  - The site is divided in two clearly marked "sides":
    - **Left/Top Side: Marketing**
    - **Right/Bottom Side: Coding**
  - Visually separated through **color palette**, **animations**, and **section transitions**.
- **Base Template**: Follows the original template (dark, sleek, modern), but introduces visual duality.
